## Tip Calculator

Tip Calculator is a web application built with React.js that helps users quickly and accurately calculate the tip amount for a bill. It offers a user-friendly interface where users can enter the bill amount, select the tip percentage, and optionally split the bill among multiple people. The application instantly displays the calculated tip amount and the total bill amount, making it convenient for users to determine their share of the bill.
